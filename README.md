# Exovis

A single night at a professional telescope can cost up to $70k AUD. For this reason astronomers need to plan very carefully their observational campaigns.
Using Lomb-Scargle periodogram and Monte Carlo simulations, **Exovis** calculates the probability to detect a planet as a function of the following parameters:
- Pysical properties of the planet;
- Pysical properties of the hosting star;
- Expected precision in radial velocity;
- Number and cadence of observations.
